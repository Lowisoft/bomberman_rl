# Reinforcement Learning for Bomberman

## Description

In this project, we apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the classic game Bomberman, focusing on the design, optimization, and evaluation of RL agents in a grid-based version of the game. We develop and improve two RL models, a Double Deep Q-Network using Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) and a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network. The extraction of the features is done automatically by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Based on the results of the experiments, we decided to submit the former of the two models to the final tournament under the name *saiboter*. Our best model wins 60% of games against three rule-based agents, scoring more than twice as many points as the best opponent.

##  Branches

This repository contains the following branches:

- **master**: The final submission of our agent.
- **test_submission_1**: The first test submission of our agent.
- **test_submission_2**: The second test submission of our agent.
- **dev_normal_dqn**: The development of the normal Deep Q-Network.
- **dev_dueling_dqn**: The development of the Dueling Deep Q-Network.
